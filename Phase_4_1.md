# 4.1 FCTS extraction
Once the final RF classifier had been trained, the percentage of pixels in each class was computed for each image. For this, images were selected from the series (see section 2.3.1), for each image the selected features were computed, and percentages of each class within each image was calculated using the RF classifier developed in subsection 2.3.3.
